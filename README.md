# MusicRecommender
During my freshman year of college, my friend and I wrote the music recommendation program,
which recommends music to users based on user's and their preferences stored in the musicrecplus.txt file. If your computer does not have a file under that name,
the program will create a file under that name and store the user's and their preferences in the new file. This program uses a similar system to Amazon's product
recommendation system.
